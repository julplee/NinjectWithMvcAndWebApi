NinjectWithMvcAndWebApi
=======================

This project shows how to implement an Ninject in an ASP.Net MVC4 project with Web Api controllers too.
As you probably know, the goal is to provide a Dependency Resolver to ASP.Net MVC and ASP.Net Web Api. 

== Requirements ==
* Visual Studio 2012
* ASP.Net MVC4
* ASP.Net WebApi

Depending on your target application, you may want (or need) to remove the silverlight projects from the solution.

== Build for .NET 4.0 ==

NinjectWithMvcAndWebApi is built for .NET 4.0 primarily.
